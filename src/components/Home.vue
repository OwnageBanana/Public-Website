  <h1>Hi! ðŸ‘‹ </h1>

  <p>
    I'm Adam Mills and this website is dedicated as a repository for anything <!-- <br/> -->
    that my mind settles on long enough to be considered a project, something <!-- <br/> -->
    to showcase or simply share through the internet.
  </p>
  <p>
    below you'll find a quick synopsis of what I have been up to: What books I'm
    reading projects I'm working on, topics I'm interested in and ideas I've found to be
    worth sharing
  </p>
